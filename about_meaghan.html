        <h1> <b>Meaghan O'Brien</b> </h1> 
        <hr/> 
            <p> My name is Meaghan O'Brien. I am 16 years old and a curent junior at Padua Academy. I am the youngest out of my four siblings. I have three sister: Courtney, Caitlin, and Colleen. Courtney and Caitlin have gratuated from Padua Academy, and Colleen is a current senior. I also have one dog, named Shadow, and two cats, named Flynn and Max. My mom's name is Rose  and my dad's name is Steven. We have lived in Aston, Pennsylvania for the past 19 years. My favorite TV show currently is <i>You</i> on Netflix.</p>
            
            <p> I currently work at Concordville Target after school and on the weekends. I work in the Softlines department, so I am a cashier when necessary, I answer guest calls, I put out new product,  handle returns, and clean up the clothing and accessories department. I usually work 2-3 weeknights and both Saturday and Sunday. My shifts can be really long sometimes so I am usually very tired, but I try my best to balance work and school. </p>
            
            <p> When I am not working, I enjoy spending time with my friends and family. I am a coffee drinker so I enjoy going to caf√©'s. I also enjoy hiking. I really like long car rides because genuinly enjoy talking with people. When it's rainy outside or I'm stuck in the house, I like to listen to acoustic music and take naps. I enjoy traveling so I am really looking foward to going to a college outside of Pennsylvania and Delaware. Currently, my top choices are Loyola in Baltimore Maryland, and Virgina Tech in Virgina. For school, I am looking to go into Photography and graphic design in Marketing and Advertising. </p>
